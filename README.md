		<p style="background-color:White;"> I currently concentrate in History and Literature and African American Studies. I am an off-cycle junior living in Quincy house and am originally from Miami, Florida. Some of my favorite hobbies are photography and hiking outdoors which I find the Everglades National Park to be perfect for. I also keep an aquarium and an interesting collection of Tarantulas I hold very dear. Most of all I am a dog lover and my little Dachshund, "Muad'Dib," is my best friend.<p>

<h3 style="background-color:White;"> Final Project Proposal </h3>

<div class="col-md-9">
		<p style="background-color:White;"> I am currently thinking about creating a bluetooth shutter release for my Mamiya M645 as only shutter release cables have been ever been released for this camera with little to no adapters for modern cables. I find myself hindered, especially while working alone, in the ability for self-portraiture which the Mamiya excels at. The device would connect to my phone via app and simply trigger the shutter similar to existing mechanisms in other Mamiya accessories.
